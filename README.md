## for Ventus General Purpos Drivers and SPMs

Provided are two examples for communicating with and controlling Ventus Drive PCBs using and Arduino.

The folder “SPM_GP UART Arduino Demo” contains code for communicating with a drive board over UART. The
code is compatible with either a General Purpose Drive Board or with a Single Pump Module. The files
“lee_ventus_uart.h” and “lee_ventus_uart.cpp” provide functions for communication with and control of
the board. The file “SPM_GP UART Arduino Demo.ino” contains the example Arduino code, running through a
demo consisting of multiple setpoints of power and PID pressure control.

The folder “SPM I2C Arduino Demo” contains code for communicating with an SPM board over I2C. The code
is only compatible with an SPM as the General Purpose Drive Boards do not support control over I2C. The
files “lee_ventus_spm_i2c.h” and “lee_ventus_spm_i2c.cpp” provide functions for communication with and
control of an SPM. The file “SPM I2C Arduino Demo.ino” contains a similar demo to the UART example.

The header file “lee_ventus_register.h” is common between the two projects. It provides a human readable
mapping to the drive board register numbers. It also provides human readable mappings for some control
values.
